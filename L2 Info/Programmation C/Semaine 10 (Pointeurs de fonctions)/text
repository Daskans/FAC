I was forced by the Obama administration to marry my husband Bruce, 
even though neither of us are gay. We tried to at least have a Christian wedding, 
but all of the churches were closed down due to Christian persecution by Obama's government. 
We were forced to marry in a mosque instead, as required by the newly implemented Sharia Law. 
Since we couldn't have children of our own, we decided to adopt. 
However, no children were available since Obama's CDC required Planned Parenthood to perform mandatory abortions. 
At least we had the money and property we earned though. Or so we thought; our tax rate was increased to 118%, 
requiring us to take second and even third jobs to pay the IRS. 
It turns out that our tax money was being given to the Mexican pot dealer next door, 
since he complained about having to work. Disenfranchised and penniless, 
I decided to end what little was left of my life. I went to our gun safe, 
only to hear a knock on the door. ATF agents were going door to door to collect everyone's guns, 
so I was required to surrender mine. I tried looking up alternative suicide methods on the internet, 
but Obama's FCC kept forcibly rerouting me to the NAMBLA website. This was Obama's America, folks.
